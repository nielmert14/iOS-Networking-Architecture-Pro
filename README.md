Overview
This project provides a complete framework for enterprise iOS apps that need robust networking. It blends a rigorous architecture with practical features. You get an efficient cache layer, a reliable offline story, and real-time synchronization capabilities. The system is built to scale in teams, across apps, and across devices. It favors clear APIs, strong typing, and predictable behavior.

The architecture aims to minimize network chatter while maximizing data freshness. It does this through layered caching, smart invalidation, and a pluggable interceptor system. It also supports offline-first flows, so users can continue to work even without a stable connection. When connectivity returns, a synchronized state is pushed and merged safely.

Why this project exists
Enterprises rely on iOS apps to act as the primary human-machine interface for critical workflows. In those contexts:
- Network latency can be costly. Users expect fast, responsive experiences.
- Data may be temporarily unavailable. Apps must function offline and recover gracefully.
- Data must be consistent across devices. Real-time updates help keep teams aligned.
- Security and reliability are non-negotiable. The architecture must be auditable and robust.

To address these needs, this project provides:
- A modular, testable network stack with consistent abstractions.
- A top-level cache that reduces load on the server and accelerates user flows.
- An offline mode that preserves user actions and resolves conflicts deterministically.
- A real-time sync layer that propagates changes efficiently while handling latency and order issues.
- A request interceptor system for logging, authentication, retries, and feature flags.
- A Swift Package Manager-friendly setup to ease integration in modern iOS projects.

Core concepts
- Layered architecture: The system is built in layers that separate concerns. Each layer has a clear API and a single responsibility.
- Deterministic caching: The cache uses defined TTLs, invalidation rules, and policy-driven refresh to keep data fresh without overwhelming the network.
- Hopeless-avoidant offline: When the device is offline, actions are queued and replayed when connectivity returns.
- Real-time awareness: A real-time channel keeps clients up to date with the latest state, reducing stale data and manual refreshes.
- Interceptor pipeline: Each request passes through a chain of interceptors. This makes it easy to add cross-cutting concerns without touching core logic.
- Pluggable persistence: You can choose between in-memory caching, disk-backed caches, or custom stores to fit your appâ€™s needs.
- Testability by design: The code is structured around protocols and abstractions to enable unit and integration tests.

Architecture at a glance
- Networking Core: Handles HTTP requests, error mapping, retries, and timeouts. It provides a clean, high-level API for making network calls.
- Cache Layer: Stores responses, metadata, and computed state. It supports expiration, invalidation, and custom eviction strategies.
- Persistence Layer: Manages offline data storage and conflict resolution. It ensures consistency between local and remote data.
- Real-Time Sync Layer: Maintains a push or long-polling channel to receive updates as they happen. It feeds updates to the app in a consistent manner.
- Interceptor Layer: A pipeline where each interceptor can observe and modify requests and responses. It enables features like retry logic, analytics, and authentication token refresh.
- SDK and Family APIs: High-level APIs that expose a friendly surface for app code. These APIs hide the complexity of the underlying layers.
- Package Management: Fully compatible with Swift Package Manager (SPM) for easy integration with modern iOS projects.

Modules and responsibilities
- CoreNetworking: Central place for sending HTTP requests, handling errors, and mapping responses to domain models.
- CacheEngine: An optimized cache with TTL, LRU eviction, and size-based limits. It supports transactional updates for consistency.
- OfflineStore: A disk-backed store with queues for offline actions and a conflict resolution strategy.
- SyncEngine: Real-time synchronization, change tracking, and conflict-aware merge logic. It coordinates with the remote server and local store.
- Interceptors: A set of interceptors including logging, retry, authentication, and analytics. They can be swapped or extended as needed.
- PersistenceAdapters: Adapters for different persistence backends (SQLite, Core Data, file-based, etc.).
- SPMPackage: Swift Package Manager integration scaffolding, example manifests, and documentation.
- TestingKit: Helpers for unit tests, mocks, and integration tests.

Caching system
- Behavior: The cache stores HTTP responses, parsed domain models, and derived state. It reduces redundant network calls and speeds up UI rendering.
- Eviction: A combination of LRU and TTL-based eviction ensures the most recent data is kept while limiting memory and storage usage.
- Invalidation: Cache invalidation happens on explicit refresh calls, on cache aging, and when a server signals changes via real-time events.
- Consistency: Cache entries map to versioned entities. If a conflict is detected, the system can fetch the latest from the server or apply a deterministic merge policy.
- Offline-friendly: Cached data is available when offline, with a graceful fallback to stored content. Synchronization uses a queue to apply remote changes when the network returns.
- Observability: Tracing and metrics surface cache hits, misses, eviction rates, and refresh latency to help you tune performance.

Offline support and data persistence
- Offline-first workflow: Actions performed offline are queued and replayed when connectivity returns.
- Local persistence: Disk-backed storage preserves user changes and app state across launches.
- Conflict resolution: When the same data is updated in parallel on the server and on the client, a deterministic merge strategy or server-defined resolution is chosen.
- Synchronization strategy: On reconnection, queued actions are batched and published. The system resolves ordering and deduplicates changes.
- Data integrity: The offline store uses transactional updates to ensure data integrity even when multiple actions occur in quick succession.
- Schema evolution: Migration routines adapt local data structures to server-side models with minimal user impact.

Real-time synchronization
- Real-time channel: The architecture supports a persistent channel for updates. It can be WebSocket-based or a long-polling fallback depending on environment constraints.
- Event models: Changes flow as events (create, update, delete, patch). Each event carries a version and origin metadata.
- Ordering guarantees: The system can enforce causal order in most cases, with fallback strategies when messages arrive out of order.
- Delta updates: Network payloads are optimized to send only changed fields, reducing bandwidth.
- Conflict handling: Real-time events are merged using a defined policy. In some cases, server-side reconciliation is required.
- Presence and subscriptions: Clients can subscribe to specific data domains and receive presence information when relevant.

Request interceptors
- Logging: Lightweight, structured logs of requests and responses. Logs help diagnose issues without exposing sensitive data.
- Retry policies: Automatic retries with backoff strategies. Retries are bounded and consider idempotency and token expiration.
- Authentication: Token refresh logic ensures quotes stay valid. The system can refresh tokens on 401 responses and retry once.
- Caching hints: Interceptors can influence cache behavior, such as forcing a refresh or bypassing the cache for certain requests.
- Feature flags: Interceptors can gate features behind remote or local flags, enabling safe experimentation.
- Telemetry: Lightweight metrics collection to measure performance, reliability, and user impact without overloading the app.

Swift Package Manager integration
- Modularity: The architecture is designed to be consumed as a Swift package. You can cherry-pick modules to fit your app needs.
- Dependency management: The package defines clean interfaces to minimize coupling and maximize testability.
- Build and test: A set of sample targets helps you quickly verify integration in a clean environment.
- Interop: The package works well with existing app architectures, making it easier to adopt gradually.

Getting started
- Prerequisites:
  - Xcode 14+ or newer
  - iOS 12+ minimum (adjustable per module)
  - Swift 5.5+ language features
- Quick setup with Swift Package Manager:
  - Add the package to your Xcode project via File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency, then point to the repository.
  - Select the modules you want to use: CoreNetworking, CacheEngine, OfflineStore, SyncEngine, Interceptors, PersistenceAdapters.
  - Build and run a minimal example to verify integration.
- Quick start example:
  - Create a simple API model and a service that uses CoreNetworking to fetch data.
  - Enable caching for read-heavy endpoints to reduce round trips.
  - Implement an offline action queue for user-driven actions when the device is offline.
  - Wire up a real-time subscription for updates to critical entities.
- Example code (short illustration):
  - This sample shows a simple fetch with caching and a retry interceptor. It is designed to be a starting point for integration and experimentation.

  - Import statements:
    - import CoreNetworking
    - import CacheEngine
    - import Interceptors

  - Basic usage:
    - let client = NetworkClient(baseURL: URL(string: "https://api.example.com")!)
    - client.addInterceptor(LoggingInterceptor())
    - client.enableCaching(for: "/users")
    - client.request(.get("/users/123"), decode: User.self) { result in
        switch result {
        case .success(let user):
          print("Fetched user: \\(user.name)")
        case .failure(let error):
          print("Request failed: \\(error)")
        }
      }

  - Offline flow:
    - offlineQueue.enqueue(.updateUser(user))
    - onNetworkReconnect { offlineQueue.flush() }

  - Real-time subscription:
    - let stream = RealTimeStream(topic: "users/123")
    - stream.onEvent { event in
        // Merge with local cache
      }

- Recommended starter pattern
  - Start with a small feature area, like caching for a single endpoint.
  - Add offline support for the same endpoint.
  - Introduce a real-time listener for a separate domain, such as "projects" or "messages."
  - Layer in interceptors gradually to avoid large surface area changes.

Code quality and patterns
- Protocols over concrete types: Expose clear interfaces that are testable and decoupled.
- Dependency injection: Provide dependencies via constructors, not global state.
- Clear error handling: Define a robust error hierarchy and map remote errors to local error types.
- Small, focused types: Each type has a single responsibility and helps readability.
- Testability: Build with test doubles; include mocks and stubs for network calls.

Performance and reliability
- Network efficiency: Intelligent caching reduces repeated fetches and network latency.
- Offline resilience: Actions queue safely and replay predictably.
- Real-time efficiency: Delta updates minimize payload sizes and keep the app in sync with server state.
- Observability: Instrumentation supports monitoring cache throughput, offline queue depth, and real-time event latency.
- Resource usage: The system tracks memory and storage usage to avoid bloat on devices with limited resources.

Testing and quality

Implementation details and patterns
- Protocol-oriented design: The system uses protocols to define interfaces. This makes swapping implementations easier and keeps tests fast.
- Dependency injection: Constructors receive dependencies, making it simple to substitute mocks during tests.
- Clean separation between concerns: Network concerns, caching, and persistence are independent modules with clear contracts.
- Error-first approach: All failure modes are surfaced through a well-defined error type.

Integration patterns and examples
- Basic fetch with cache header handling
  - The fetch path reads from cache when possible and validates the TTL.
  - If the cache is stale, it fetches from the server and updates the cache.
- Offline queue example
  - User action creates a queued item with a domain and payload.
  - On network return, the queue flushes, applying changes to the server.
- Real-time update example
  - Subscribing to a topic triggers updates in the local store and refreshes the UI.
  - The system merges changes in a deterministic manner to avoid data inconsistency.
- Interceptor example
  - A token refresh interceptor detects 401 responses, refreshes the token, and retries the request.
